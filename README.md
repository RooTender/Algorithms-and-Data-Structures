# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
C++/C program about Algorithms and Data Structures

## Why such a project?
Well... as a student I found it hard to analyze data structures and algorithms by watching only the content from YT or sites for geeks.
So I've decided to make a project that will contain all the algorithms that I had read about and merge them into one repository.<br/>
Now you can clone this repository and unpack it in for example Visual Studio, then start debugging.<br/>
I hope my code review comments would help you with figuring out what's going on there.

## What's implemented now?
Sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (NEW!)
