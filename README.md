# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
C++/C program about Algorithms and Data Structures

## Why such a project?
Well... as a student I found it hard to analyze data structures and algorithms watching only the content from YT or sites for geeks.
So I've decided to make a project that will contain all the algorithms that I had read about and merge them into one repository.<br/>
Now you can clone this repository and open in for example Visual Studio and start debugging.<br/>
I hope my comments would help you with figuring out what's going on there.
